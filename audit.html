      <tr>
        <td>Engagement: How engaging is the app? Is it visually appealing? Does it have sound and animation to capture the user's attention? Does it have a good balance of challenge and reward?</td>
        <td>Kahoot allows users to create and upload quizzes and play fun games (eg in a classroom setting) with a large group to test their knowledge on a nearly unlimited pool of subjects, keeping users engaged. <br> (10/10)</td>
        <td>typing.com allows users to practice their typing skills through a series of exercises, from beginner to intermediate level practice. I find the visual aspect more engaging than the exercises, but overall it does a decent job. <br> (4/10)</td>
        <td>CodeCombat uses the guise of a game to teach coding basics, defaulting to python code, with more options available, I find this quite engaging, but not very exciting and I've seen this idea better executed in games like graphomata. <br> (6/10) </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Progress tracking: How well does the app track the user's progress? Does it provide feedback and recommendations to help users improve their performance? Does it use data to personalize the learning experience?</td>
        <td>Since students are not required to create an account, students' progress isn't tracked by default. But teachers can select from a list of subjects to be shown, allowing for more personalised learning. <br> (3/10) </td>
        <td>typing.com allows users to save their progress, and while the current exercise is marked clearly, there is no fixed order to the exercises and users may complete them in the order of their choice. <br> (9/10)</td>
        <td>CodeCombat uses a series of game stages and worlds to track progress, with advanced levels locked behind easier levels and a subcription to the website. Unlike typing.com the levels aren't clearly labelled with their content and worlds have more general titles. <br> (6/10)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>User experience: How user-friendly is the app? Is it easy to navigate and use? Does it have clear instructions and prompts? Does it have a well-designed interface?</td>
        <td>Kahoot is incredibly user friendly, for educators and students, educators need to login to an account, then simply find and select an appropriate quiz, and allow students to enter the pincode provided on kahoot.it <br> (8/10)</td>
        <td>typing.com excels in this field, I would give it higher if I could. The website is very easy to navigate and everything is clearly labelled. Only the coding practice is locked by subscription and account creation is encouraged but not required. <br> (10/10)</td>
        <td>CodeCombat has a kind of ugly interface and very basic visuals. Some aspects (damage, health, hero type) are unclear and add needless complications, the website also prompts you with account creation and premium subscription every chance it gets. <br> (2/10) </td>
